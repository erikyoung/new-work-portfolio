					 <p class=" primary-users-bit"> Teacher Tussles is an app that provides a place for teachers to take out their frustrations and have a collective experience. The app is meant to be easy to use, provocative in nature, and social, so that everyone can share amongst their colleagues and peers; it is meant to serve as a resource for teachers to set aside the stresses of their job and create friendly competitions between friends. </p>
					 <br /> 
					 <p class="primary-goals">The research for this app showed that most teachers suffer from chronic stress in some way, shape, or form. In the vast majority of cases, the stress of the job is cumulative, not cumulative or specific. In reflection of this, the findings of the research showed that we needed to design something that would allow teachers to create a digital avatar for themselves, be able to challenge each other in a flexible way, and be able to share those results amongst friends and peers if they so felt like it. </p>
