					 <h1 id="target-user">Summary<br /><br /></h1>
					 <p class="primary-users-bit">Spotify is amongst the most popular streaming music applications in existance. While the accessbility of music and the discovery of new music remains their core business, in recent years there has been a growing interest in expanding music into the social sharing sphere. </p>
					
					 <br /> 
					 <p class="primary-goals">The primary users are people who are looking for music that will match their mood. Most users revealed that when they look for ‘mood music’, they often rely on music that they already know. While Spotify allows users to select music amongst a number of lists that have been created, however, they currently have  to spend a lot of time to look through the lists and find something that they find relevant. With this new feature, users can sort based on four basic moods. These lists will allow you to narrow down your selection faster.   </p>

					<div class="margins-div">
					 <p class=" primary-users-bit">Research began by looking at the current landscape of online streaming music. We started with an exhaustive competitive analysis to see who the major players in the market were and what points of  differentiation may have existed. The goals here were straightforward: to better understand how sharing was being done by any competitors, and to what extent was it successful; we also wanted to see how we could further distinguish our own existing product and develop a truly organic social music sharing sphere. Here is a quick look at where we started off:<br /> 
 						<br /> 
				     </p>
					 <br />

					 <p class=" primary-users-bit">We inverviewed 6 people, ranging in age from 21 to 51 to get a diverse range of perspectives from people who buy products or regularly do any shopping. During the interviews, the emphases of our interviews was on their recollection of a recent shopping experience. Through this retelling of their experiences, we looked deeply at the motivations behind certain purchases and understanding the drivers that went into certain purchases as well as what pain points came up during their shopping experience. We then used this information to inform the main content of our page and how we intended to proceed with building out the site. <br />

					As a general summary, we discovered that purchases are not done randomly; rather, they are part of a variety of circumstances, recent decisions and experiences, and even marketing that has led to their purchase. On top of that, we also discoverd what they want out of a shopping experience as well: maximum info and maximum convenience. <br /> 
 						<br /> 
 					Primary research was done with 17 different people. At first, individual interviews were conducted to get direct feedback on students aboout they music sharing habits generally, when they shared music, and what kinds of moods and/or other psychological triggers were part of this. From there, we worked through a problem statement and ideation strategy to uncover how we could best take their feedback and develop those ideas. This part was developed into 3 strategies:

				    	<li>Problem Statements (“How Might We..?”)
</li>
				    	<li>Ideation (Crazy 8’s)
</li>
				    	<li>Storyboarding</li>

					 <p class=" primary-users-bit">With all this research and useful information from users, there were several personas that could have been chosen. The best thing to do then was to look at the clusters of charateristics from each of them to develop a unifying persona. Here is what came out: </p>

					<p class=" primary-users-bit">From there, we began the work of looking at how the layout of the user experience would begin with the initial steps into the Information Architecture. Given that much of the site is focused on helping the user get to the product they want as fast as possible, the site is built on providing lots of filters and navigation that will let you pick what you’re after and checkout as painless as possible.  </p> <br />

					<p class=" primary-users-bit">What we can derive from the site map and the user flow is this: users are going to be able to find what they need; be able to add it to their cart, keep shopping if they want; otherwise, they’ll begin to checkout.  </p> <br />

					 <p class=" primary-users-bit">Getting to the wireframes was a fairly straightforward process because we knew what the users wanted: lots of sales, lots of suggestions, lots of choices. We knew these were priorities, so our landing page needed to express that. Aside from that, the bulk of our page from then on primarily reflected the user flow.  </p>

					  <p class=" primary-users-bit">From a UI perspective, what we realized for this site was that much of the content was going to be occupying the user’s eye, so lots of colors and emphasis on others aesthetics was not going to be a primary concern for us; rather, let the products do the talking for us.   </p>

					<p class=" primary-users-bit">
					Usability testing confirmed our belief at this point: we had built something that made sense to the user and was easy to use. Earlly iterations of the testing were a little bit rough, but much of that was due to the fact that users were not that familiar with low-fidelity mockups of the site, so there was some basic issues with navigation. Prototyping is also an area people are not that used to as well, so getting a feel for the limitations of a site such as that was also a consideration.  </p><br />

				<h1 id="target-user">Reflection</h1>
				<div class="margins-div">
					<p class=" primary-users-bit">
					This site was more straightforward than others given the established nature of ecommerce shopping sites. There is a lot of information that exists about this kind of site and has been done countless times by people. The real trick was finding a slick way to communicate maximum information to the user without the experience being too complicated for the user. In the end, however, I I think we came out with something solid that conveys a good shopping experience that meets most needs.
